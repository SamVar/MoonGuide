					<span class="tab">The </span> full moon is the lunar phase when the
					Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. This occurs
					when Earth is located between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when
					the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180°). This
					means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth – the near side – is
					completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs
					roughly once a month.The time interval between a full (or new) moon
					and the next repetition of the same phase, a synodic month, averages
					about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those lunar calendars in which each
					month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either
					the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month. Because a calendar month
					consists of a whole number of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be
					either 29 or 30 days long. <br />

					<span class="tab">Throughout </span> the history of the Earth, the
					Moon has been a major influence on the evolution of the land, ocean
					and life. For Billions of years the Moon has been stirring the oceans
					in its never ending orbit. Scientist believe life itself may not have
					been possible without the Moon's tidal mixing of the oceans that
					created the complex chemical compounds that were necessary for life to
					begin. It makes sense that our lives today are influenced by the Moon
					Phase, position and proximity to Earth. Whether it’s some deep
					chemical reaction or more of a spiritual connection it’s easy to see
					the influence.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Doctors</span> and Nurses dread the Full Moon each
					month when the emergency rooms are filled with people giving birth.
					Ask a police officer and they will tell you there is a heightened
					energy in the air on a Full Moon and New Moon. It’s on these days that
					the craziest things happen in the world. The Moon is one of the most
					powerful symbols in astrology. Some people are more in tune with their
					Birth Moon Phase or Zodiac Moon Sign than the more common zodiac Sun
					Sign. Like the Sun Sign, your Birthday Moon Phase and Moon Sign can
					tell you a lot about yourself. The current Moon Phase today or the
					Phase on your Current Birthday is also said to influence our
					day-to-day lives. Explore the links below to see the diffences of
					being born on the different Moon Phases.

				<h1>Moon Phase Personality Descriptions</h1>

				<p class="paragraph-body">
					<span class="tab">Your</span> astrological sign may cover the
					positioning of the planets at the time of your birth, but it doesn’t
					cover one of the most potent energy fields on Earth: the moon phase
					you were born in. The “lunar personalities” are the 8 phases of the
					moon cycle: New Moon, First Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous,
					Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter and Waning Crescent. They can
					shed light on not only some of your qualities and tendencies, but more
					importantly, the first energy you were exposed to on Earth, and how it
					affects the way your path here will unfold.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> importance of the Moon and its phases
					throughout history can be clearly seen by how prominently Moon phases
					feature in the calculation of dates for major religious festivals.
					Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after the first Full Moon
					after the March equinox. In 2008, the March equinox is March 20; there
					is a Full Moon March 22; the Sunday after that is March 23. Easter
					Sunday in 2008 is March 23. The Full Moon can occur anywhere up to a
					month after the March Equinox; this is the reason the date of Easter
					changes so much from one year to the next. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish
					“head of the year” or New Year festival “starts at sunset on the day
					of the New Moon closest to the September Equinox”. Numerous other
					religious festivals across a number of faiths (including Ramadan,
					Hanukkah, Purim and both the Vietnamese and Chinese New Year) are
					timed to either New or Full moons in certain astrological signs or in
					relation to a specific equinox or solstice.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">In</span> modern astrological practice the Moon
					phases are used to describe the pulse or tone of your birth chart and
					your life. All other birth chart factors, like planetary placements
					and aspects, are modified by the energy of your Moon phase. The
					importance of Moon phases, long respected by ancient astrologers, was
					reintroduced to the modern world through the early parts of the
					twentieth century by the astrologer Dane Rudhyar. There are also links
					between Moon phases and reincarnation, though these beliefs would have
					evolved centuries earlier, out of eastern astrological philosophies,
					where fate and karma have a larger part to play. Our obsession with
					our Sun Sign or Star Sign is a reflection of society’s obsession with
					the individual ego, the conscious mind and one’s creative output
					(qualities of the Sun). Equally, you could say “I am a New Moon phase”
					or “I am a Full Moon phase”; this description describing your
					instinctive personality urges, from an emotional, unconscious and soul
					perspective (moon qualities).
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun or Star sign is simply one of the
					easiest astrological factors to generalise, making it easy to cater to
					the general public via sun sign columns and the like. A few minutes
					research or inquiry with an Astrologer would confirm for you what Moon
					phase you were born under. Your Moon phase describes your personality
					profile and reflects the basic pulse of your life. Your Sun sign is
					subtly, but essentially different depending on which phase of the Moon
					you were born under. The combination of Sun Sign and Moon phase
					creates a holistic description of an individual as it caters to the
					masculine/ yang (Sun) and feminine /yin (Moon) aspects of human
					nature.

					Symbolic of a new beginnings, the New Moon signals the end of an
					entire Lunar Cycle which leads to the next New Moon. Those born under
					this phase are supercharged with the renewing, spiritual energy of the
					Universe. They have an affinity for all things creative and tend to be
					imaginative, intuitive and impulsive -- occasionally making decisions
					without thinking them through. Yet when they commit to their passion,
					they do so with a strong resolve to develop, cultivate and make
					manifest. Although, as lunar energy ebbs and flows, staying connected
					to their inner resolve becomes difficult at times. Mania, nervousness
					and racing thoughts may develop, signaling a time to slow down and
					feel the earth underfoot. By letting go of all fears, worries and
					self-judgement, they will begin again to give birth to new ideas and
					concepts. Wear this moon phase to honor birthdays or any sacred date
					and energize your life with the spirit of new beginnings.

					Those born under the influence of this moon phase are assertive,
					adventurous and filled with curiosity about life. Happiest while
					pursuing a worthwhile mission, their drive for achievement is central
					to their success. Typically individuals born in the first half of the
					moon cycle are involved in establishing new structures, systems and
					schools of thought. A creative disposition inspires inquiry and an
					ability to see the world through fresh eyes. Because of this, these
					visionaries are often torn between following conventional wisdom and
					risking all to break new ground. Facing and overcoming imbalance and
					chaos brings likely success early in life when ambition and
					productivity is especially high. Wear this moon phase to honor
					birthdays or any sacred date and capture the lucky sliver of silver
					light to bring heartfelt dreams to fruition.

					The first quarter Moon is the first critical point in the Moon cycle
					and there is an element of tension or nervous energy in the heart of
					all individuals born at this time. Like the planet which now must take
					risks as it pours energy into strengthening its position, individuals
					born at the First Quarter Phase are passionate, confident and natural
					risk takers. They are quick to act but can carry a chip on their
					shoulder, as if they are trying to prove something to the world. This
					makes them great leaders as they always rise to challenges. Anger need
					to be managed consciously and healthy physical outlets are important.
					A key phrase for this phase is “Crisis in Action”. First Quarter
					individuals can feel that life is a challenge they need to beat. They
					are ambitious, self motivated and independent and once they’ve decided
					to do something are hard to stop. Determination is one their key
					strengths.

					One of the best lunar phases to give spiritual evolution a boost,
					those born under the influence of this moon phase are quick thinkers
					and grand philosophers that desire to seek out the meaning in life.
					They have a natural talent for communication and self-expression and
					love to analyze everything to come up with solutions that benefit
					everyone. his Moon phase is about self development and perfection,
					symbolic of the plant who is now preparing it’s offerings through
					fruit and flowers. Those born at this Moon phase are acutely aware of
					how important planning and organisation are. Yet, they don’t well in
					isolation. Being in communion with partners, lovers, mentors, teachers
					and friends brings them comfort and the mental and emotional growth
					that leads to their success. Wear this moon phase to honor birthdays
					or any sacred date to attract the partnerships that brings love and
					luck to life.

					Since the moon controls our emotional energy, those born at its
					fullness may feel its effects in the extreme. Expressing emotions and
					understanding them may be hurdles to conquer. Yet on the positive
					side, they are extroverted and friendly with magnetic personalities
					and known as truthful individuals who are likely to tell it like it
					is. During a full moon, most feel exhilarated, inspired and motived
					toward success and accomplishment while others may feel chaotic and
					disorganized. Full moon babies are also quick studies who master tasks
					easily and are equally given to quick changes of mind and heart which
					to some may appear as fickleness. Even so, their strong intuition is
					always guiding them in making their efforts come to fruition,
					especially when following their passions. Wear this moon phase to
					honor birthdays or any sacred date and channel the moon’s emotional
					wisdom to bring success to personal endeavors.

					Sharing the attributes of Waning Gibbous, those born under the
					influence of this moon phase are considered the caretakers of the
					Universe. Their calming influence, caring nature and compulsion to
					help others gives valuable insight into their strong will and
					character and often shows up as a career in public service. An
					eagerness to make the world a better place may tempt them to follow
					ideologies too blindly. This moon phase individuals are precise and
					question everything. They are highly creative without being impulsive.
					Yet most can rely on strong intuitive powers to see that shred of
					waning light before making wrong decisions. Remaining strong in the
					face of adversity, uncertainty and unforeseen obstacles leads to their
					greatest achievements and fulfillment in life. Wear this moon phase to
					honor birthdays or any sacred date to channel strength, enlightenment
					and a generosity of spirit.

					For people born on Third Quarter the mid life period, from the late
					thirties to early fifties, is filled with change, as previously
					conservative or mainstream Third Quarter individuals make dramatic
					shifts, embracing alternative life choices to pursue a life aligned
					with their personal philosophy. Often there is a key event through
					this time which acts as a catalyst. Friends, family and colleagues may
					struggle to understand why, at the heights of their career, Third
					Quarter types walk away from all they’ve built up. This phase is
					described as a “Crises in Consciousness” which reflects the importance
					of acting in accordance with their beliefs. Third Quarter Moon phase
					types are constantly re-valuating the old, and as they move through
					life, turn away and discard old patterns. Many cut ties with the
					beliefs or philosophies of the culture or community in which they were
					raised. Third Quarter types easily combine instinct with creativity.

					Waning into total darkness, the moon’s shrinking light may decrease
					illumination in the night sky yet intensifies psychic illumination for
					those born under its influence. Feeling attuned to psychic experiences
					and dreamy, otherworldly dimensions is not uncommon as the imagination
					is in full force during this slim moon phase. Their challenge is not
					to lose sight of the real world while staying connected to this
					spiritual gift from the Universe that bridges them to energies beyond
					the earthly realm. Wear this moon phase to honor birthdays or any
					sacred date and delve into the deeply intuitive world of the waning
					crescent. These folks tend to be very reflective and prefer their
					alone time. They are very spiritual and seek to understand the big
					questions in life and may be very intuitive or psychic. Their lesson
					is to distill what they have learned from situations into wisdom to
					share with others.

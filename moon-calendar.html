			content="Moon Phase Calendar gives you visual representation of moon's phase for the given month and year. The full moon is the lunar phase when the Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. This occurs when Earth is located between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180°). This means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth – the near side – is completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs roughly once a month.The time interval between a full (or new) moon and the next repetition of the same phase, a synodic month, averages about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those lunar calendars in which each month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month. Because a calendar month consists of a whole number of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be either 29 or 30 days long."

					<span class="tab">The </span> full moon is the lunar phase when the
					Moon appears fully illuminated from Earth's perspective. This occurs
					when Earth is located between the Sun and the Moon (more exactly, when
					the ecliptic longitudes of the Sun and Moon differ by 180°). This
					means that the lunar hemisphere facing Earth – the near side – is
					completely sunlit and appears as a circular disk. The full moon occurs
					roughly once a month.The time interval between a full (or new) moon
					and the next repetition of the same phase, a synodic month, averages
					about 29.53 days. Therefore, in those lunar calendars in which each
					month begins on the day of the new moon, the full moon falls on either
					the 14th or 15th day of the lunar month. Because a calendar month
					consists of a whole number of days, a month in a lunar calendar may be
					either 29 or 30 days long. <br />

					<span class="tab">Throughout </span> the history of the Earth, the
					Moon has been a major influence on the evolution of the land, ocean
					and life. For Billions of years the Moon has been stirring the oceans
					in its never ending orbit. Scientist believe life itself may not have
					been possible without the Moon's tidal mixing of the oceans that
					created the complex chemical compounds that were necessary for life to
					begin. It makes sense that our lives today are influenced by the Moon
					Phase, position and proximity to Earth. Whether it’s some deep
					chemical reaction or more of a spiritual connection it’s easy to see
					the influence.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Doctors</span> and Nurses dread the Full Moon each
					month when the emergency rooms are filled with people giving birth.
					Ask a police officer and they will tell you there is a heightened
					energy in the air on a Full Moon and New Moon. It’s on these days that
					the craziest things happen in the world. The Moon is one of the most
					powerful symbols in astrology. Some people are more in tune with their
					Birth Moon Phase or Zodiac Moon Sign than the more common zodiac Sun
					Sign. Like the Sun Sign, your Birthday Moon Phase and Moon Sign can
					tell you a lot about yourself. The current Moon Phase today or the
					Phase on your Current Birthday is also said to influence our
					day-to-day lives. Explore the links below to see the diffences of
					being born on the different Moon Phases.

				<h2>Moon Phase Personality Descriptions</h2>

				<p class="paragraph-body">
					<span class="tab">Your</span> astrological sign may cover the
					positioning of the planets at the time of your birth, but it doesn’t
					cover one of the most potent energy fields on Earth: the moon phase
					you were born in. The “lunar personalities” are the 8 phases of the
					moon cycle: New Moon, First Crescent, First Quarter, Waxing Gibbous,
					Full Moon, Waning Gibbous, Last Quarter and Waning Crescent. They can
					shed light on not only some of your qualities and tendencies, but more
					importantly, the first energy you were exposed to on Earth, and how it
					affects the way your path here will unfold.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> importance of the Moon and its phases
					throughout history can be clearly seen by how prominently Moon phases
					feature in the calculation of dates for major religious festivals.
					Easter Sunday is always the first Sunday after the first Full Moon
					after the March equinox. In 2008, the March equinox is March 20; there
					is a Full Moon March 22; the Sunday after that is March 23. Easter
					Sunday in 2008 is March 23. The Full Moon can occur anywhere up to a
					month after the March Equinox; this is the reason the date of Easter
					changes so much from one year to the next. Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish
					“head of the year” or New Year festival “starts at sunset on the day
					of the New Moon closest to the September Equinox”. Numerous other
					religious festivals across a number of faiths (including Ramadan,
					Hanukkah, Purim and both the Vietnamese and Chinese New Year) are
					timed to either New or Full moons in certain astrological signs or in
					relation to a specific equinox or solstice.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">In</span> modern astrological practice the Moon
					phases are used to describe the pulse or tone of your birth chart and
					your life. All other birth chart factors, like planetary placements
					and aspects, are modified by the energy of your Moon phase. The
					importance of Moon phases, long respected by ancient astrologers, was
					reintroduced to the modern world through the early parts of the
					twentieth century by the astrologer Dane Rudhyar. There are also links
					between Moon phases and reincarnation, though these beliefs would have
					evolved centuries earlier, out of eastern astrological philosophies,
					where fate and karma have a larger part to play. Our obsession with
					our Sun Sign or Star Sign is a reflection of society’s obsession with
					the individual ego, the conscious mind and one’s creative output
					(qualities of the Sun). Equally, you could say “I am a New Moon phase”
					or “I am a Full Moon phase”; this description describing your
					instinctive personality urges, from an emotional, unconscious and soul
					perspective (moon qualities).
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun or Star sign is simply one of the
					easiest astrological factors to generalise, making it easy to cater to
					the general public via sun sign columns and the like. A few minutes
					research or inquiry with an Astrologer would confirm for you what Moon
					phase you were born under. Your Moon phase describes your personality
					profile and reflects the basic pulse of your life. Your Sun sign is
					subtly, but essentially different depending on which phase of the Moon
					you were born under. The combination of Sun Sign and Moon phase
					creates a holistic description of an individual as it caters to the
					masculine/ yang (Sun) and feminine /yin (Moon) aspects of human
					nature.

					<span class="tab">The</span> New Moon represents a clean start, like a
					new seed breaking the surface after a period in the darkness. It
					heralds a time when there is a movement towards the future and has a
					particular sort of sensitivity. Imagine this tentative seed – it may
					survive, it may be at the mercy of the elements. This is reflected in
					the nature of the individual born at that time. It signifies vitality
					and the urge to survive but also a certain vulnerability. New Moon
					people tend to experience the world in a very subjective manner. There
					is always a personal approach to their attitude on life and there is
					little confusion in their outer and inner expression when both
					Luminaries are in the same sign. Their awareness or consciousness of
					self is easily reflected into the world, and the world can seem to
					present many challenges. This person meets those challenges in an
					attempt to grow and survive. A keyword might be ‘enthusiasm’. The Yin
					signs,( for the same sign New Moon) will tend towards subjectivity and
					inner growth while the Yang signs tend towards worldly achievement.
					The person is optimistic, trusting, and is almost incapable of seeing
					negativity in life, so great is his eagerness to experience himself
					and his life. He is born with an innately positive outlook and carries
					it through despite setbacks, bouncing back from difficulties to rise
					again to the challenge.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">This</span> first phase consists of the urge to
					experience life, to grow and initiate, gather momentum and can
					envisage or imagine fulfillment. Following on from the ‘Dark Phase’,
					which, symbolically, is one of incubation and fertility, the
					personality is no longer embryonic but filled with vitality but also
					with a certain sensitivity and fragility as it ‘breaks out’ into the
					world. These people seem to know that they must survive the best they
					can and the person has a psychic awareness that it must meet many
					challenges. They are markedly independent and meets those challenges
					as part of their life expectations. Often, though, the person takes on
					far more than he should – he forgets that he is ‘new’ and therefore
					‘naïve’ and will tend to rush headlong into life, trusting to luck. He
					often finds it! The New Moon personality shines with eagerness. One
					might expect an impulsive nature, depending on the sign, and even the
					introverted signs will still have a keen interest in life and its
					challenges. The person might be particularly emotional and responsive
					to others but by nature is innately self-involved. He investigates
					life as though the world is a new land to be explored and great
					discoveries are to be made to which he can append his name. Because of
					his subjective nature there could be some impatience regarding the
					place or needs of others and a tendency to ‘ride roughshod’ in the
					urge to make inroads in life. This is not deliberate but simple
					enthusiasm running away on its own energy.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">New</span> Moon people are ‘self starters’ – they
					take up challenges and even create them for themselves. They are goal
					oriented often without any particular end in view, but simply because
					they enjoy tackling new things. So they are starters but not always
					finishers! They need the discipline of time – just as the new seed
					must be given time to thrive and grow, so often early life is littered
					with challenges and projects gone wrong, or unfinished. Later in life
					these people become very productive as their progressed cycle
					coincides with the cycle of Saturn and they will experience a
					Progressed Lunation around the same time as Saturn returns to its
					birth position.

					</a>
					<span class="tab">The</span> Crescent personality has an innate sense
					of the positives and negatives and so is no less keen but more
					cautious, weighing things up before taking the initiative. But he can
					lack clarity because of this and there is often both eagerness and
					resistance, an urge to both move forward and at the same time stay
					comfortable in the safety zone of what is familiar. There is some
					insecurity embedded in this person, a tentative approach, yet a
					curiosity and need to explore life which is very strong and
					motivating. The metaphorical seed we saw emerge from the dark earth
					now has its first leaves and has survived the first storms and danger,
					allegorically committing the perils to memory, if plants could be
					imagined to have memories! The psyche does! The keywords here might be
					‘anticipation and hesitation’.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">These</span> people seem aware that there are
					challenges and tensions to be overcome. For this reason, people born
					at this phase can have a problem defining goals and direction in life,
					‘in case things go wrong’. But once having established some direction,
					they will make a clean break and move ahead full steam! Then they
					surprise everyone with the thrust and purpose after first appearing
					tentative. We see this in those who break with tradition, with
					parental expectation, and often with the country of birth! They trust
					implicitly in their own capacity for survival and have a naiveté and
					thrust that is quite charming, much less ‘gung-ho’ than their New Moon
					cousins but no less enthusiastic. These people seem sometimes to have
					a ‘burr under the saddle’ – they are somewhat driven in their need to
					achieve in life. Depending on the Yin and Yang of the signs involved
					in the Crescent personality, they will tend to be a little variable,
					but once a decision is made will move forward.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">This</span> phase includes the quintile and sextile
					aspects, both of which are practical ‘working’ and ‘creative’ so the
					personality cannot remain static but forges ahead with goals in view,
					completing them, even though they may lose interest along the way. In
					anticipation of a long journey ahead, in order to achieve future
					growth, the personality phase is akin to a child leaving home for the
					big world of adulthood. Often in order to be successful he needs to
					make a permanent break. This is not always physical, but a break with
					the morality, educational bias, traditions and habits. Familiarity
					makes it hard to leave security, but by his nature he is driven to do
					so. They may at times appear to hover on the brink of decision-making
					and action, and need encouragement to explore but rarely do they
					become stuck for too long!
					<br />
					<span class="tab">They</span> often maintain a youthful demeanour and
					even when old, might exhibit a candour and innocence that is extremely
					charming. Advancing, without needing to justify their actions, or
					becoming overwhelmed by fear of progress, is a challenge that this
					personality must meet head on if they are to get the best out of life.
					They often seem to need to explain or seek ‘permission’ to act
					assertively, yet have a strength that is quite surprising when they
					let it show! They often need time to assimilate and assess challenge,
					to determine direction and may appear to vacillate. They live in
					anticipation, learn through experience so that as they mature, they
					become bolder and more assertive. They are born with enormous
					potential but need time to activate it. They will rise to the
					challenge, only to retreat when blocked. Often the ability to retreat
					is useful because they re-gather their resources and come out fighting
					after ‘regrouping’.

					<span class="tab">Personalities</span> born at this phase will
					maintain a similar ‘style’ of expression – the urge for growth through
					change and simply go about it a different way. How they go about
					achieving change will depend to a large extent on the sign involvement
					because at the square, archetypal ‘issues’ can be highly challenging.
					For example the Sun in Aries and the Moon in Cancer might experience
					tension about autonomy and family patterning. The Sun in Cancer and
					the Moon in Libra might experience tension between family and
					intimacy. The Sun in Libra and the Moon in Capricorn might be born
					expecting to experience dilemmas involving intimacy and status. With
					the square, change is achieved forceful and deliberate and willful. So
					this personality is entrenched with the desire for growth but tends to
					do so at the expense of inner peace – aware of relationship dilemmas
					and might unconsciously force issues in order to break free of what he
					perceives to be limiting factors.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> phase embodies ambition but sometimes at
					a cost. The metaphorical seed has not only broken the surface but is
					developing its leaves and reaching for the sunshine – but it is
					exposed to the wind and rain, frost and heat, and so experiences a
					critical phase – will it live, will it die – does it have to complete
					for its place in the sun with others of its kind? This personality
					might even experience a form of rejection by family, or least feel
					that he doesn’t ‘fit’ and this can be emotionally difficult to handle,
					yet it leaves him free to explore his own world and crisis in one form
					or another can be the catalysis for this. The tension that is inherent
					within the personality is often reflected in the tensions within the
					parental relationship, which is often seen by the person as an
					inharmonious one. So he often has to deal with feelings of ‘taking
					sides’ – not only with parental relationships but also in other
					relationships in life.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">He</span> may find himself in situations where he
					has to make choices between opposing forces. He may become independent
					at an early age. His internal dilemma is most often that achievement
					comes at the expense of emotions and full expression of emotion leaves
					him feeling that he has lost control. This is a ‘bridge’ between
					conscious Sun and unconscious Moon, where objectivity and subjectivity
					clash so that the personality can express in unpredictable and
					reactive behavioural patterns. Action, instinct, crisis, reaction, the
					setting of purposeful goals, the building of framework and forward
					momentum, independence of thought and action can create a ruthlessness
					about this personality that is strongly rooted in parental
					conditioning and the risk that he carries and fulfilsthe parental
					‘issues’.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">As</span> the person comes to terms with his own
					drives an enormous sense of purpose and clarity of direction is
					established. Thus we find the potential high achiever. This is a
					personality that has a sense of self but has to struggle to adapt to
					the society in which it lives. Some of the struggles and crisis this
					personality experiences is in finding a niche in life. Since this
					phase incorporates the opening or waxing trine, and we can assume that
					better understanding comes at the trine, or at least, better
					acceptance and less stress, the person born later in the phase deals
					with issues more calmly and resolutely, healing more quickly and
					accepting of those things he cannot change. Thus, it may be easier to
					deal with stress for those born at the trine. Sun and the Moon are in
					the same element family so the energy flows easily and there is an
					intensification of self-development. The paradox in this entire phase
					is that while one experiences crisis and stress in the desire for
					change, another will makes his transitions with ease. But the desire
					and urge is no less intense. With the trine, there is acceptance of
					conflict and easier handling of challenges.

					<span class="tab">This</span> personality is fully aware of his
					potentials and keen to understand and develop them. He does not seek
					to do so in a crisis ridden way but is more patient and accumulative.
					He acquires skills and understands the need for deliberation in
					achieving in life. He is blessed with an intuitive faculty that is not
					impulsive, but balanced between personal subjective goals and
					awareness of how other might help him achieve them. It is less driven
					than the phases that have gone before. The person is keenly aware of
					social norms and expectations, takes what is of value to him and
					easily rejects the rest. He does so with an intuitive understanding
					that by accumulating material, knowledge and information he will gain
					later life. He is more a ‘gatherer’ than a hunter is with a direct
					approach, a progressive and optimistic outlook and a willingness the
					use whatever skills and material comes to hand to achieve.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> tale of the plant is now fully into
					survival – this phase is an accumulative stage and one in which our
					plant begins to show its potential – is it a petunia or is it an apple
					tree? It knows, and begins to take on its future form – feeding and
					growing at a rapid rate – its roots are firmly in the ground from
					where it draws its sustenance. So it is with the gibbous personality.
					They know who they are and have firm idea of what they want! He is
					aware that adjustments have to be made between personal desires and
					the needs of others and so is generally able to compromise. However,
					in doing so, he does not lose sight of his personal direction, but is
					clear on what he wants within the framework of his culture, society
					and its demands, and the political norms and creative opportunities
					presented to him. . He has the most developed ability to be consistent
					and persevere. So he may appear placid, but is resilient well grounded
					and resolute. He may not be entirely willing to compromise his own
					desires but if it suits his long term purpose will see the politics of
					appearing to do so. He can be truculent if he can see no advantage. He
					is clear on who he is and what he wants.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">This</span> phase brings objectivity as the
					predominant attitude and the person is less dependent on instincts for
					survival and more on ‘playing’ the system to find the means. He is
					capable of and does, plan ahead and arrange for his own survival. Part
					of the life pattern for this personality, especially when young is to
					discover that life has a ‘pecking order.’ He is determined on his own
					growth and so might tend to ‘usurp’ those who stand in his way.
					However, he learns intuitively to avoid those who would threaten him
					and to cultivate those who will enable him to find his own niche. We
					might say this personality has all the makings of a political animal –
					in touch with society and other people yet still able to use that
					framework to further his own goals. He has a strong sense of identity
					but often relies on other people to reflect the sense of ‘I’. Feedback
					from others is very important and needs to be confirmed in childhood.
					If aspects to the luminaries are encouraging, this person is able to
					put himself across in an affable and sociable way. If not, he can be
					beset with a desire to grow that pays scant attention to the lawful
					means by which he can obtain his needs. He is able to write the rules
					to suit himself. He has a capacity to analyse future directions and
					past indiscretions and get them firmly in perspective, so he learns by
					his mistakes.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">This</span> is he who ‘marches to a different drum’
					at times but is well aware that he is doing so and can use it to
					further his aims! The urge to reform and improve is strong. Thus we
					find the person out in the world, extroverted rather than introverted,
					not tentative but forward seeking, gathering and accumulating all that
					might come in useful further down the track! The person is often a
					store of knowledge and experience ranging from trivia to profound
					understanding.

					<span class="tab">The</span> Moon is at its ‘largest’ about to begin
					its waning stage. Relationships with others and with the world at
					large loom largely in this person’s life experience. They are born in
					anticipation that to be who they are, largely depends on other people
					in their lives so there is a paradox in balancing the ‘me’ with the
					‘you’. They are capable of alternating between riding rough-shod over
					the needs of others, or of being so aware of the others needs that
					they neglect their own. What has happened to our tree? It now stands
					tall and exposed. It dares the wind to blow it over, the sun to burn
					it, water to flood it – and when these things happen it survives
					because it has the strength to withstand the elements. It purpose now
					is not so much self preservation as preservation of its species, and
					so it sets fruit and seeds – and the first seeds are immature and need
					time to develop. Some will some won’t. Those that are fertile stay,
					those that are not fall to the ground.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">So</span> there is a sense of life and death,
					fertility and barrenness that. reflected in the personality, can pull
					in one direction or the other. Polarisation occurs so often this
					personality seems pulled in two directions. They can act in a manner
					that is best described as ‘extremist’. Balance and constancy requires
					a constant shift in perspectives on life and the person has to find a
					way to stay on the ‘middle road’. This creates many extremes in their
					lives. Because the Sun and the Moon are opposite each other there is
					no obstacle to illumination and the person is innately aware of both
					his ego and his ‘soul’ and torn between the needs of each. The
					constant pull between objective world experience and subjective inner
					experience is at worst tormenting and at best a permanent dilemma for
					Full Moon personalities. One moment they find themselves secure and
					sure of their personal material or intellectual direction and the next
					they are plunged into emotional and relationships turmoil.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> two poles are clearly separate. Ideally
					this promises the well rounded, mature personality, capable of innate
					sense of the profane and sacred parts of himself but the mere dynamic
					of the opposition means he is in a constant state of flux – walking an
					elemental tightrope. Rarely will the balance occur for the
					satisfaction of the person. This is the ‘full on’ personality. Like
					its New Moon partner, it is highly motivated but has the ‘follow
					through’ to achieve, so is often impatient to ‘end’ and get on to the
					next goal. Highly creative, obviously expressive, capable of being
					self destructive, with hair trigger emotions, these personalities are
					seen, want to be seen, are driven to seek approval from others in one
					way or another, and this desire for approval is projected into the
					world of relationships. Following the Gibbous phase where feedback is
					a necessary resource for growth, for the Full Moon personality, such
					confirmation is a commodity that has to come in a constant stream as
					self-esteem can swing to extremes.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">He</span> can be supremely confident in his approach
					to life, only to swing into periods of self-doubt. So his life
					patterns tend to leap from one extreme to another. He is his own best
					friend or worst enemy, and will project this into relationships so if
					you are loved by or love a Full Moon do not expect this to be an easy
					ride, because the lines between love and hate are thin! Motivation is
					high, yet can be pulled back by emotional forces. Social norms and
					primitive instincts vie for attention and the person is often torn
					between the need to conform to the requirements of relationships and
					social life and the inner urge for freedom and anarchy! There is a
					keen sense of purpose and the need to express life ‘full on’. Maturity
					enables the person to fulfil the innate promise of personal
					self-development together with world achievement. He becomes able to
					use it to advantage, so often the volatile child turns into the high
					achiever in later years, but before doing so,will go through
					tumultuous experiences that teach him some hard lessons about
					co-operation.

					<span class="tab">This</span> is a phase of distribution,
					communication and illumination. The Disseminating Moon person has an
					inborn need to spread the word – to announce his presence and even
					boast of his prowess! He is well able to publicise ideas and is
					strongly motivated at a social level. Social structures and society at
					large benefits from this personality, and he benefits from it, but he
					is in danger of becoming swamped by his own enthusiasms. He is vested
					with a desire to instigate social reform, but at times needs to stop
					and take into consideration that the world may not be ready for him!
					He is a visionary and his vision of the future leaves no room for
					limiting structures and traditions. He pushes the boundaries, and like
					his Gibbous cousin, can do so in an almost amoral way, but does so
					less for personal gain and more for the ’cause’.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">They</span> may embody the motto – the End justifies
					the Means! The tree now has fruit and seeds in abundance. It scatters
					the seeds that are ripe with a dancing abandonment for it’s purpose is
					well defined. It revels in the elements for it is in tune with them
					and realises their purpose. This is a joyous time of shedding those
					seeds that will ensure its life is meaningful and its species will
					survive! Dissemination means to scatter far and wide and our tree uses
					nature to do this. Such people are involved in communication, often
					teach, have concerns with the law, and structural norms of society and
					are extroverted by nature. They express themselves with ease around
					the trine, but can later experience difficulties as the closing square
					is approached, so his greatest lesson is not to take his talents for
					granted but to re-focus them in a collective way. His is the
					personality with social leadership potential, able to convey the needs
					of the group, to act in protecting, altering the thinking and
					attitudes of the collective. He can be somewhat dictatorial and
					demanding in being ‘always right’. He is born with an innate sense
					that all things change and are impermanent and on the move. He has a
					visionary bent and clarity of focus but also a sense of ‘timing’ and
					seems to need to ‘get a piece of life’ while the going is good!
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Those</span> concepts that personally concern the
					individual are those that he uses to benefit the whole. So we find
					someone oriented towards causes, in helping professions, where his
					innate ability to communicate is expressed. This is the position of
					informing and educating those with whom there is contact. He is
					altruistic, but can have a garrulous and socially seeking edge. He may
					appear to act on impulse, but rarely does. His challenge is in
					prioritising for he can scatter his energies and spread himself
					thinly. He wants to be all things for all people. As children these
					types are ‘old heads on young shoulders’. As teachers,lawgivers, and
					information disseminators they mature early. This personality can
					motivate others towards reform and they are often the spokesmen for
					society. Immobility and unquestioning acceptance, resting on one’s
					laurels is anathema for this personality. Life will seem pointless
					unless they have the means to broadcast, share and experiment and
					explore. For this reason, the person may engender belief systems
					simply for the sake of action. The need is for caution and for
					determining which facets of life have real significance rather than
					for him to become involved in trivial or mundane activities just for
					excitement.

					<span class="tab">Those</span> born at this phase are confronted with

					realities of systems and facts. He is the spokesman for the collective
					but also risks biting off more than he can chew. His challenge is to
					determine how much of himself he is prepared to sacrifice for the

					family – often parents and the wider family hierarchy, to the ‘tribal’
					structure of the community. He is torn between traditional values and

					groups and those with whom he associates and needs to fit with the
					structural norms and also incorporate his own ideals within those of
					the group. Thus, at a positive level he can achieve personal ambitions
					through the group, or change the group to suit his ends!
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Either</span> way he is tied to the moral fibre of
					others. Here are the philosophers of the world, who do not necessarily
					act to make reform happen, but push others into doing so, from a more
					‘managerial’ stance. Such personality types require recognition from
					the ‘system’ and often work and live within strict boundaries and
					their dichotomy is that they wish that things were different. They
					often ask, ‘why am I here’, ‘what is my purpose in life’ So he can
					‘fit in’ to a business world by day and an esoteric world by night! He
					is indeed more comfortable by night, if truth were told! What of the
					tree? Its fruiting over, its seeds scattered there is time of rest in
					preparation for dormancy.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> elements have scarred the branches, some
					branches are not fruitful, and so the tree is pruned by life. Withered
					branches fall as the wind races through them. The tree stands at the
					mercy again of the elements, not in the same way as it did at the
					opening square, but in a more mature way, as dead leaves begin to fall
					and all that is useless in preparation for the next season, is
					removed. Human intervention in the form of life, may even shape it so
					that it conforms to and stands in the same image as others of its
					kind. Negatively, the person can be overcome by inertia or paralysed
					by fear of loss. He can be inflexible and so will experience loss as
					he has a natural tendency to set himself up for failure if he is not
					willing to embody new attitudes and change his behavioural patterns.
					He can swing between the secure and proven yet inwardly knows that he
					must change, or he will be left behind in the ever increasing pace of
					life. This person can tend to become pessimistic, if his philosophies
					are thwarted, trapped within the systems of life, and obligations,
					until he espouses philosophical awareness of the future.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Career</span> and other affiliations often are
					crisis ridden and often associations need to be abandoned, or refined
					in some way. This person is born with a sense of vocation. It often
					takes a long time to shake off the desire to conform in order to tap
					into his ‘calling’. The parental marriage might have seen one parent
					completely dominating or dictating to the other. Thus the person is
					imbued with the need to suppress either his emotional inner self, or
					gives sway to inner life and has difficulty living in the here and
					now. This is a tense position and like its counterpart the first
					square, leads to a personality under stress. Inner conflicts,
					insecurities and struggles are often not articulated. Stress at an
					inner level builds up and the risk of outbursts and reactionary and
					revolutionary behaviour is at odds with the seemingly calm outer
					appearance.

					<span class="tab">This</span> is the phase of transition and
					preparation for transformation. This personality experiences life in
					the knowledge and anticipation of radical change, but knows
					instinctively that this will only come after some sacrificial or
					ritual death. Society and hierarchies, people with power sit uneasily
					with them. Yet they do not rebel. They are the introverts who take
					everything life dishes out deep into the psyche for analysis and
					transformation. They are often hesitant to make long term commitment
					in worldly activities as though prompted that ‘there just isn’t enough
					time’ to waste. So they are best equipped to make commitment in less
					achievement oriented fields and more in ‘backstage’ ways where, they
					can question, query, hypothesise, postulate and investigate future
					potentials.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">They</span> are the prophets, and the ‘sensitives’
					with an intuitive understanding and clairvoyant view of the future.
					They experience hard lessons in life by being forced to let go of,
					discard and deal with loss at different levels both within and
					without. Yet they are the best equipped to do so and move on, for they
					have an inbuilt sense of the transformative impermanence of life,
					relationships and their own selves. They are often involved in short
					term projects, appear sociable, yet are keenly separate, not ever
					feeling entirely comfortable with groups associations, yet driven to
					join for the comfort that affiliation brings.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Their</span> sense of ‘not belonging’ is keenly felt
					so they seek others of like mind – those who live life at an internal
					level and have a strong ‘persona’ which protects the real inner Self.
					Solitude is common. The Balsamic Moon person has much to offer in
					wisdom and experience if he can overcome his pessimism. There is an
					untapped depth to their experience and understanding, fertility that
					is futuristic and can be transformative if applied to the benefit of
					others. Their beliefs and knowledge seem to come from a collective
					source and the intuitive, even psychic function is strong. They lean
					toward religious philosophy, although often denying it. They believe
					in ‘luck’, both good and bad, destiny and Karma. Profound and
					instinctive, they are equipped to experience the animal levels of
					being as well as the highest level of abstracted elevation and so
					combine psyche and soma.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">They</span> are often intuitive healers, their
					bodies often sensitive to changes and they can be found in
					institutions, caring for the needy, often at the risk of their own
					health. Confidence levels are often outwardly low and they hesitate to
					express their intuitive nature openly, so the depth of psychic
					evolution is rarely discovered except when life thrusts them into dark
					phases. The tree enters its period of dormancy, confident that in due
					time and the right season, it will ‘rise again’. Now its leaves fall
					and become the food for the future. It may look sad and dead in the
					winter of its life, but deep in the earth, fertile growth occurs. It
					seeds, shed earlier and beginning to warm and feed on the compost and
					the tree simply waits [patiently for the seasons to roll. So it is
					with the balsamic personality.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">They</span> have embedded knowledge that everything
					occurs according to its season and are often content with that. The
					Balsamic person often has to set aside his or her own subjective needs
					in order to fully feel a sense of oneness with the collective. They
					are ‘loners’. They may well be affable, willing workers, yet never are
					completely at ease, in the world of challenge. They seek enlightenment
					because of a well-developed sense of imperfection and potential for
					spiritual renewal. Self is a temple ready to receive enlightenment.
					and the search is an ongoing theme. Consequently they tread a
					spiritual path and desire to gain wisdom from the most mundane of
					tasks. They seek transformation through service to others and
					sometimes martyrdom. They can often be seen to care for their health
					with an almost obsessive drive to perfect it, then go through periods
					of unprecedented neglect. They work in quiet ways, involved in
					‘backroom’ research rather than upfront activation and while they have
					much knowledge, and insight, rarely expose themselves to criticism, or
					take risks with knowledge.

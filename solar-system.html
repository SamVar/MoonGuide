					<span class="tab">The </span> Solar System is the gravitationally
					bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly
					or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest
					are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the
					dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit
					the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet,
					Mercury. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the
					gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The
					vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of
					the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> four smaller inner planets, Mercury,
					Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily
					composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets,
					being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two
					largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of
					hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune,
					are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively
					high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called
					volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have
					almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the
					ecliptic. The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid
					belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly
					contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and
					metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc,
					which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of
					ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Within</span> these populations, some objects are
					large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is
					considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be. Such
					objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified or accepted dwarf
					planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects
					Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions, various other
					small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary
					dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the
					six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are
					orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon.
					Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and
					other small objects.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> solar wind, a stream of charged
					particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region
					in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is
					the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the
					opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the
					edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the
					source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a
					thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is
					located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the
					Milky Way galaxy.

					<span class="tab">Our </span> solar system extends much farther than
					the eight planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes
					the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a sparsely
					occupied ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular
					Kuiper Belt Object, dwarf planet Pluto. And beyond the fringes of the
					Kuiper belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds
					our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its
					existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations
					of comets that likely originate there. The Oort Cloud is made of icy
					pieces of space debris the sizes of mountains and sometimes larger,
					orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light years away. This shell of
					material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000
					astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from
					the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
					The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence,
					where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite
					as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind—a
					stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all
					directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by
					pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock. This
					edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units. The distance from Earth
					to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit [AU] (150,000,000 km; 93,000,000
					mi). For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km).
					Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere
					with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is
					roughly one millionth (10−6) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest
					planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000 km) from the Sun and
					has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most distant
					planet, Neptune, is 30 AU (4.5×109 km) from the Sun. With a few
					exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger
					the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object
					to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out
					from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter,
					and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to
					determine a relationship between these orbital distances, but no such
					theory has been accepted.

					<span class="tab">The</span> Solar System formed 4.568 billion years
					ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large
					molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years
					across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular
					clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and
					small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of
					stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the
					pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused
					it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected,
					became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">As</span> the contracting nebula rotated faster, it
					began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly
					200 AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by
					accretion from this disc,in which dust and gas gravitationally
					attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds
					of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they
					either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets,
					and leftover minor bodies. Due to their higher boiling points, only
					metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar
					System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky
					planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements
					only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the
					terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets
					(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the
					frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where
					material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid.
					The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals
					and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them
					to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and
					helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that
					never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt,
					Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the
					creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed
					in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through
					various gravitational interactions.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Within</span> 50 million years, the pressure and
					density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough
					for it to begin thermonuclear fusion. The temperature, reaction rate,
					pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was
					achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this
					point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase,
					from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun
					compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's
					pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the
					heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the
					protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary
					formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its
					main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.
					The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the
					hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium,
					which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the
					end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun
					will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding
					the inert helium, and the energy output will be much greater than at
					present.

					<span class="tab">The</span> principal component of the Solar System
					is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the
					system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four
					largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the
					remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than
					90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four
					terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets)
					together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.
					Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of
					Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets are very close to
					the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are frequently at
					significantly greater angles to it. As a result of the formation of
					the Solar System planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the
					same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed
					from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's
					Comet. Also most of the larger moons orbit their planets in this
					prograde direction and most larger objects rotate themselves in the
					same direction (with Venus being a notable retrograde exception).
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> overall structure of the charted regions
					of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner
					planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant
					planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects.
					Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate
					regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets
					and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids,
					including the four giant planets. Since the discovery of the Kuiper
					belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a
					distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune. Most of the
					planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being
					orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two
					of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury),
					and, in the case of the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin
					bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest
					natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face
					permanently turned toward their parent.
					<br />

					<span class="tab">Kepler's</span> laws of planetary motion describe
					the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each
					object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects
					closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly
					because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical
					orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its
					year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion,
					whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion.
					The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets,
					asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits.
					The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using
					numerical models. Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it
					accounts for only about 2% of the angular momentum.The planets,
					dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular
					momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance
					from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun, which comprises nearly all the
					matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and
					helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise nearly all the remaining
					matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A
					composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and
					light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which
					are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements
					with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed
					largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the
					Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense is
					known as the frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> objects of the inner Solar System are
					composed mostly of rock, the collective name for compounds with high
					melting points, such as silicates, iron or nickel, that remained solid
					under almost all conditions in the protoplanetary nebula. Jupiter and
					Saturn are composed mainly of gases, the astronomical term for
					materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure,
					such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, which were always in the gaseous
					phase in the nebula. Ices, like water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen
					sulfide, and carbon dioxide, have melting points up to a few hundred
					kelvins. They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various
					places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in
					the solid or gaseous phase. Icy substances comprise the majority of
					the satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and
					Neptune (the so-called "ice giants") and the numerous small objects
					that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.Together, gases and ices are referred
					to as volatiles.

					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun is the Solar System's star and by far
					its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),
					which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces
					temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear
					fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This
					releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as
					electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light. The Sun is a
					G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more
					luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the
					hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter
					than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars,
					known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way. The
					Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements
					heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance)
					than the older population II stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and
					helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the
					first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be
					enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals,
					whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought
					to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system
					because the planets form from the accretion of "metals"
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun currently fuses about 600 million
					tons of hydrogen into helium every second, converting 4 million tons
					of matter into energy every second as a result. This energy, which can
					take between 10,000 and 170,000 years to escape from its core, is the
					source of the Sun's light and heat. When hydrogen fusion in its core
					has diminished to the point at which the Sun is no longer in
					hydrostatic equilibrium, its core will undergo a marked increase in
					density and temperature while its outer layers expand, eventually
					transforming the Sun into a red giant. It is calculated that the Sun
					will become sufficiently large to engulf the current orbits of Mercury
					and Venus, and render Earth uninhabitable – but not for about five
					billion years. After this, it will shed its outer layers and become a
					dense type of cooling star known as a white dwarf, and no longer
					produce energy by fusion, but still glow and give off heat from its
					previous fusion.

					<span class="tab">The </span> four terrestrial or inner planets have
					dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They
					are composed largely of refractory minerals, such as the
					silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals, such as iron

					than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of
					hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune are far less massive—less than
					20 Earth masses each—and are composed primarily of ices. For these
					reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category,
					ice giants.[98] All four giant planets have rings, although only
					Saturn's ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term superior
					planet designates planets outside Earth's orbit and thus includes both
					the outer planets and Mars.

					<span class="tab">Mercury</span> (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest
					planet to the Sun and on average, all seven other planets. The
					smallest planet in the Solar System, Mercury has no natural
					satellites. Besides impact craters, its only known geological features
					are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of
					contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere
					consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its
					relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been
					adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were
					stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully
					accreting by the young Sun's energy. Its orbit around the Sun takes
					87.97 days, the shortest of all the planets in the Solar System. It is
					named after the Roman deity Mercury, the messenger of the gods. Like
					Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an inferior
					planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as viewed from Earth
					never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun means the planet can only
					be seen near the western horizon after sunset or eastern horizon
					before sunrise, usually in twilight. <br />
					<span class="tab">At</span> this time, it may appear as a bright
					star-like object, but is often far more difficult to observe than
					Venus. The planet telescopically displays the complete range of
					phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, as it moves in its inner orbit
					relative to Earth, which recurs over its synodic period of
					approximately 116 days. Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the
					Solar System. It is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit
					resonance, meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its
					axis exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around the
					Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that rotates with
					the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once every two Mercurian
					years.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">An</span> observer on Mercury would therefore see
					only one day every two Mercurian years. Mercury's axis has the
					smallest tilt of any of the Solar System's planets (about ​1⁄30
					degree). Its orbital eccentricity is the largest of all known planets
					in the Solar System; at perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is
					only about two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's
					surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to the
					Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive for billions
					of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain heat, it has surface
					temperatures that vary diurnally more than on any other planet in the
					Solar System, ranging from 100 K (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K
					(427 °C; 800 °F) during the day across the equatorial regions.[18] The
					polar regions are constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F).

					substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its atmosphere is being
					replenished by volcanic eruptions.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Venus</span> is the second planet from the Sun. It
					is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. As the
					second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus
					can cast shadows and, rarely, is visible to the naked eye in broad
					daylight.[16][17] Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never
					appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting in the west just
					after dusk or rising in the east a bit before dawn. Venus orbits the
					Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243 Earth days,
					it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any planet in the Solar
					System and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus
					(meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east). Venus does
					not have any moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among
					planets in the Solar System.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Venus</span> is a terrestrial planet and is
					sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar
					size, mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is
					radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest
					atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than
					96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface
					is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000
					ft) underwater on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the
					Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863
					°F), even though Mercury is closer to the Sun. Venus is shrouded by an
					opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing
					its surface from being seen from space in visible light. It may have
					had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the
					temperature rose due to a runaway greenhouse effect. The water has
					probably photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
					interplanetary space by the solar wind because of the lack of a
					planetary magnetic field. Venus's surface is a dry desertscape
					interspersed with slab-like rocks and is periodically resurfaced by
					volcanism.

					<span class="tab">Mars</span> (1.5 AU from the Sun) is smaller than
					Earth and Venus. It has an atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a
					surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its

					colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny
					natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured
					asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's
					history.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">It</span> is the fourth planet from the Sun and the
					second-smallest planet in the Solar System after Mercury. In English,
					Mars carries the name of the Roman god of war, and is often referred
					to as the 'Red Planet'. The latter refers to the effect of the iron
					oxide prevalent on Mars' surface, which gives it a reddish appearance
					distinctive among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
					Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface
					features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the
					valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. The days and seasons
					are likewise comparable to those of Earth, because the rotational
					period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis relative to the
					ecliptic plane are very similar. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the
					largest volcano and highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar
					System, and of Valles Marineris, one of the largest canyons in the
					Solar System. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere
					covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature. Mars has
					two moons, Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped.
					These may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars
					trojan.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Mars</span> has been explored by numerous unmanned
					spacecraft. Mariner 4, launched by NASA on November 28, 1964, was the
					first spacecraft to visit Mars, making its closest approach to the

					performed the first successful landing on the Martian surface.
					Although the Soviet Mars 3 spacecraft achieved a soft landing in
					December 1971, contact was lost with its lander seconds after
					touchdown. On July 4, 1997, the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on
					Mars, and on July 5 released its rover, Sojourner, the first robotic

					Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, which landed on Mars in
					January 2004 and operated until March 22, 2010 and June 10, 2018,
					respectively. The Mars Express orbiter, the first European Space
					Agency spacecraft to visit Mars, arrived in orbit on December 25,
					2003. On September 24, 2014, the Indian Space Research Organization
					became the fourth space agency to visit Mars, when its maiden

					<span class="tab">Jupiter</span> (5.2 AU), is 2.5 times the mass of
					all the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen
					and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat creates semi-permanent
					features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red
					Spot. Jupiter has 79 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede,
					Callisto, Io, and Europa, show similarities to the terrestrial
					planets, such as volcanism and internal heating. Ganymede, the largest
					satellite in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">It</span> is the fifth planet from the Sun and the
					largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass
					one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all
					the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is one of the
					brightest objects visible to the naked eye in the night sky, and has
					been known to ancient civilizations since before recorded history. It
					is named after the Roman god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter
					can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and is
					on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after
					the Moon and Venus.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Jupiter</span> is primarily composed of hydrogen
					with a quarter of its mass being helium, though helium comprises only
					about a tenth of the number of molecules. It may also have a rocky
					core of heavier elements, but like the other giant planets, Jupiter
					lacks a well-defined solid surface. Because of its rapid rotation, the
					planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid (it has a slight but
					noticeable bulge around the equator). The outer atmosphere is visibly
					segregated into several bands at different latitudes, resulting in
					turbulence and storms along their interacting boundaries. A prominent
					result is the Great Red Spot, a giant storm that is known to have
					existed since at least the 17th century when it was first seen by
					telescope. Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a
					powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter has 79 known moons, including the four
					large Galilean moons discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede,
					the largest of these, has a diameter greater than that of the planet
					Mercury.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Pioneer</span> 10 was the first spacecraft to visit
					Jupiter, making its closest approach to the planet on December 4,
					1973; Pioneer 10 identified plasma in Jupiter's magnetic field and
					also found that Jupiter's magnetic tail was nearly 800 million
					kilometers long, covering the entire distance to Saturn. Jupiter has
					been explored on a number of occasions by robotic spacecraft,
					beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby missions from 1973 to
					1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in
					1995. In late February 2007, Jupiter was visited by the New Horizons
					probe, which used Jupiter's gravity to increase its speed and bend its
					trajectory en route to Pluto. The latest probe to visit the planet is
					Juno, which entered into orbit around Jupiter on July 4, 2016. Future
					targets for exploration in the Jupiter system include the probable
					ice-covered liquid ocean of its moon Europa.

					<span class="tab">Saturn</span> (9.5 AU), distinguished by its

					its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60%
					of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive, Saturn is the
					only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The
					rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn
					has 82 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these,
					Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity. Titan, the
					second-largest moon in the Solar System, is larger than Mercury and
					the only satellite in the Solar System with a substantial atmosphere.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">It</span> is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
					second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant
					with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It only has
					one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger
					volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive. Saturn is named after
					the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄)
					represents the god's sickle. Saturn's interior is most likely composed
					of a core of iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its
					core is surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an
					intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a
					gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia
					crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within the
					metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's planetary
					magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but has a magnetic
					moment 580 times that of Earth due to Saturn's larger size.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Saturn's</span> magnetic field strength is around
					one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is generally bland
					and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind
					speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher
					than on Jupiter, but not as high as those on Neptune. In January 2019,
					astronomers reported that a day on the planet Saturn has been
					determined to be 10h 33m 38s + 1m 52s − 1m 19s , based on studies of
					the planet's C Ring. The planet's most famous feature is its prominent
					ring system, which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller
					amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to orbit
					Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not include the
					hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's largest moon, and
					the second-largest in the Solar System, is larger than the planet
					Mercury, although less massive, and is the only moon in the Solar
					System to have a substantial atmosphere.

					outer planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its
					side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the ecliptic. It has a

					heat into space. Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones
					being Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">It</span> is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has
					the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass
					in the Solar System. Uranus is similar in composition to Neptune, and
					both have bulk chemical compositions which differ from that of the
					larger gas giants Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists
					often classify Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them
					from the gas giants. Uranus' atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's and
					Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium, but it
					contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane, along with
					traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest planetary atmosphere
					in the Solar System, with a minimum temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371
					°F), and has a complex, layered cloud structure with water thought to
					make up the lowest clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> interior of Uranus is mainly composed of
					ices and rock. Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system,
					a magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a unique
					configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted sideways, nearly
					into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north and south poles,
					therefore, lie where most other planets have their equators. In 1986,
					images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus as an almost featureless planet in
					visible light, without the cloud bands or storms associated with the
					other giant planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit
					the planet. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change and
					increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox in 2007.
					Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h; 560 mph).

					internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14
					known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with
					geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a
					retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor
					planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">It</span> is the eighth and farthest known planet
					from the Sun in the Solar System. In the Solar System, it is the
					fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive planet, and
					the densest giant planet. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth,
					slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune is denser and
					physically smaller than Uranus because its greater mass causes more
					gravitational compression of its atmosphere. Neptune orbits the Sun
					once every 164.8 years at an average distance of 30.1 au (4.5 billion
					km; 2.8 billion mi). It is named after the Roman god of the sea and
					has the astronomical symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's
					trident. Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only
					planet in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather
					than by empirical observation.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Unexpected</span>x changes in the orbit of Uranus
					led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject to
					gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. The position of
					Neptune was subsequently calculated from Bouvard's observations,
					independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier after his
					death. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on 23
					September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the position
					predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was discovered
					shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's remaining 13 known
					moons were located telescopically until the 20th century. The planet's
					distance from Earth gives it a very small apparent size, making it
					challenging to study with Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited
					by Voyager 2, when it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2
					remains the only spacecraft to visit Neptune.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> advent of the Hubble Space Telescope and
					large ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics has recently
					allowed for additional detailed observations from afar. Like Jupiter
					and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed primarily of hydrogen and
					helium, along with traces of hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen,
					though it contains a higher proportion of "ices" such as water,
					ammonia and methane. However, similar to Uranus, its interior is
					primarily composed of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally
					considered "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. Traces of
					methane in the outermost regions in part account for the planet's blue
					appearance.

					<span class="tab">The </span> Solar System is the gravitationally
					bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly
					or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest
					are the eight planets, with the remainder being smaller objects, the
					dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit
					the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet,
					Mercury. The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the
					gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The
					vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of
					the remaining mass contained in Jupiter.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> four smaller inner planets, Mercury,
					Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily
					composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets,
					being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two
					largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of
					hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune,
					are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively
					high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called
					volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have
					almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the
					ecliptic. The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid
					belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly
					contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and
					metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc,
					which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of
					ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Within</span> these populations, some objects are
					large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is
					considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be. Such
					objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified or accepted dwarf
					planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects
					Pluto and Eris. In addition to these two regions, various other
					small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary
					dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the
					six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are
					orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon.
					Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and
					other small objects.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> solar wind, a stream of charged
					particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region
					in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is
					the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the
					opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the
					edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the
					source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a
					thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is
					located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the
					Milky Way galaxy.

					/></a>

					<span class="tab">Our </span> solar system extends much farther than
					the eight planets that orbit the Sun. The solar system also includes
					the Kuiper Belt that lies past Neptune's orbit. This is a sparsely
					occupied ring of icy bodies, almost all smaller than the most popular
					Kuiper Belt Object, dwarf planet Pluto. And beyond the fringes of the
					Kuiper belt is the Oort Cloud. This giant spherical shell surrounds
					our solar system. It has never been directly observed, but its
					existence is predicted based on mathematical models and observations
					of comets that likely originate there. The Oort Cloud is made of icy
					pieces of space debris the sizes of mountains and sometimes larger,
					orbiting our Sun as far as 1.6 light years away. This shell of
					material is thick, extending from 5,000 astronomical units to 100,000
					astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance from
					the Sun to Earth, or about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers).
					The Oort Cloud is the boundary of the Sun's gravitational influence,
					where orbiting objects can turn around and return closer to our Sun.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> Sun's heliosphere doesn't extend quite
					as far. The heliosphere is the bubble created by the solar wind—a
					stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun in all
					directions. The boundary where the solar wind is abruptly slowed by
					pressure from interstellar gases is called the termination shock. This
					edge occurs between 80-100 astronomical units. The distance from Earth
					to the Sun is 1 astronomical unit [AU] (150,000,000 km; 93,000,000
					mi). For comparison, the radius of the Sun is 0.0047 AU (700,000 km).
					Thus, the Sun occupies 0.00001% (10−5 %) of the volume of a sphere
					with a radius the size of Earth's orbit, whereas Earth's volume is
					roughly one millionth (10−6) that of the Sun. Jupiter, the largest
					planet, is 5.2 astronomical units (780,000,000 km) from the Sun and
					has a radius of 71,000 km (0.00047 AU), whereas the most distant
					planet, Neptune, is 30 AU (4.5×109 km) from the Sun. With a few
					exceptions, the farther a planet or belt is from the Sun, the larger
					the distance between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object
					to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU farther out
					from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter,
					and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts have been made to
					determine a relationship between these orbital distances, but no such
					theory has been accepted.

					Formation

							class="flow-right solar-system-images"
					/></a>

					<span class="tab">The</span> Solar System formed 4.568 billion years
					ago from the gravitational collapse of a region within a large
					molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years
					across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular
					clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and
					small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of
					stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the
					pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused
					it to rotate faster. The centre, where most of the mass collected,
					became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">As</span> the contracting nebula rotated faster, it
					began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly
					200 AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by
					accretion from this disc,in which dust and gas gravitationally
					attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds
					of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they
					either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets,
					and leftover minor bodies. Due to their higher boiling points, only
					metals and silicates could exist in solid form in the warm inner Solar
					System close to the Sun, and these would eventually form the rocky
					planets of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Because metallic elements
					only comprised a very small fraction of the solar nebula, the
					terrestrial planets could not grow very large. The giant planets
					(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) formed further out, beyond the
					frost line, the point between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter where
					material is cool enough for volatile icy compounds to remain solid.
					The ices that formed these planets were more plentiful than the metals
					and silicates that formed the terrestrial inner planets, allowing them
					to grow massive enough to capture large atmospheres of hydrogen and
					helium, the lightest and most abundant elements. Leftover debris that
					never became planets congregated in regions such as the asteroid belt,
					Kuiper belt, and Oort cloud. The Nice model is an explanation for the
					creation of these regions and how the outer planets could have formed
					in different positions and migrated to their current orbits through
					various gravitational interactions.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">Within</span> 50 million years, the pressure and
					density of hydrogen in the centre of the protostar became great enough
					for it to begin thermonuclear fusion. The temperature, reaction rate,
					pressure, and density increased until hydrostatic equilibrium was
					achieved: the thermal pressure equalled the force of gravity. At this
					point, the Sun became a main-sequence star. The main-sequence phase,
					from beginning to end, will last about 10 billion years for the Sun
					compared to around two billion years for all other phases of the Sun's
					pre-remnant life combined. Solar wind from the Sun created the
					heliosphere and swept away the remaining gas and dust from the
					protoplanetary disc into interstellar space, ending the planetary
					formation process. The Sun is growing brighter; early in its
					main-sequence life its brightness was 70% that of what it is today.
					The Solar System will remain roughly as we know it today until the
					hydrogen in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium,
					which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the
					end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun
					will contract with hydrogen fusion occurring along a shell surrounding
					the inert helium, and the energy output will be much greater than at
					present.

					Structure and Composition

							class="flow-left solar-system-images"
						/>
					</a>

					<span class="tab">The</span> principal component of the Solar System
					is the Sun, a G2 main-sequence star that contains 99.86% of the
					system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally. The Sun's four
					largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the
					remaining mass, with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than
					90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System (including the four
					terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets)
					together comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.
					Most large objects in orbit around the Sun lie near the plane of
					Earth's orbit, known as the ecliptic. The planets are very close to
					the ecliptic, whereas comets and Kuiper belt objects are frequently at
					significantly greater angles to it. As a result of the formation of
					the Solar System planets, and most other objects, orbit the Sun in the
					same direction that the Sun is rotating (counter-clockwise, as viewed
					from above Earth's north pole). There are exceptions, such as Halley's
					Comet. Also most of the larger moons orbit their planets in this
					prograde direction and most larger objects rotate themselves in the
					same direction (with Venus being a notable retrograde exception).
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> overall structure of the charted regions
					of the Solar System consists of the Sun, four relatively small inner
					planets surrounded by a belt of mostly rocky asteroids, and four giant
					planets surrounded by the Kuiper belt of mostly icy objects.
					Astronomers sometimes informally divide this structure into separate
					regions. The inner Solar System includes the four terrestrial planets
					and the asteroid belt. The outer Solar System is beyond the asteroids,
					including the four giant planets. Since the discovery of the Kuiper
					belt, the outermost parts of the Solar System are considered a
					distinct region consisting of the objects beyond Neptune. Most of the
					planets in the Solar System have secondary systems of their own, being
					orbited by planetary objects called natural satellites, or moons (two
					of which, Titan and Ganymede, are larger than the planet Mercury),
					and, in the case of the four giant planets, by planetary rings, thin
					bands of tiny particles that orbit them in unison. Most of the largest
					natural satellites are in synchronous rotation, with one face
					permanently turned toward their parent.
					<br />

					<span class="tab">Kepler's</span> laws of planetary motion describe
					the orbits of objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each
					object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects
					closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly
					because they are more affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical
					orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its
					year. A body's closest approach to the Sun is called its perihelion,
					whereas its most distant point from the Sun is called its aphelion.
					The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets,
					asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits.
					The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using
					numerical models. Although the Sun dominates the system by mass, it
					accounts for only about 2% of the angular momentum.The planets,
					dominated by Jupiter, account for most of the rest of the angular
					momentum due to the combination of their mass, orbit, and distance
					from the Sun, with a possibly significant contribution from comets.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun, which comprises nearly all the
					matter in the Solar System, is composed of roughly 98% hydrogen and
					helium. Jupiter and Saturn, which comprise nearly all the remaining
					matter, are also primarily composed of hydrogen and helium. A
					composition gradient exists in the Solar System, created by heat and
					light pressure from the Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which
					are more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements
					with high melting points. Objects farther from the Sun are composed
					largely of materials with lower melting points. The boundary in the
					Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could condense is
					known as the frost line, and it lies at roughly 5 AU from the Sun.
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The</span> objects of the inner Solar System are
					composed mostly of rock, the collective name for compounds with high
					melting points, such as silicates, iron or nickel, that remained solid
					under almost all conditions in the protoplanetary nebula. Jupiter and
					Saturn are composed mainly of gases, the astronomical term for
					materials with extremely low melting points and high vapour pressure,
					such as hydrogen, helium, and neon, which were always in the gaseous
					phase in the nebula. Ices, like water, methane, ammonia, hydrogen
					sulfide, and carbon dioxide, have melting points up to a few hundred
					kelvins. They can be found as ices, liquids, or gases in various
					places in the Solar System, whereas in the nebula they were either in
					the solid or gaseous phase. Icy substances comprise the majority of
					the satellites of the giant planets, as well as most of Uranus and
					Neptune (the so-called "ice giants") and the numerous small objects
					that lie beyond Neptune's orbit.Together, gases and ices are referred
					to as volatiles.

					<span class="tab">The</span> Sun is the Solar System's star and by far
					its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses),
					which comprises 99.86% of all the mass in the Solar System, produces
					temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear
					fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This
					releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as
					electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light. The Sun is a
					G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence stars are more
					luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate between that of the
					hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter
					than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars,
					known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way. The
					Sun is a population I star; it has a higher abundance of elements
					heavier than hydrogen and helium ("metals" in astronomical parlance)
					than the older population II stars. Elements heavier than hydrogen and
					helium were formed in the cores of ancient and exploding stars, so the
					first generation of stars had to die before the Universe could be
					enriched with these atoms. The oldest stars contain few metals,
					whereas stars born later have more. This high metallicity is thought
					to have been crucial to the Sun's development of a planetary system
					because the planets form from the accretion of "metals"

				<h1>
					Inner and Outer Planets
				</h1>
				<p class="paragraph-body">
					<span class="tab">The </span> four terrestrial or inner planets have
					dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. They
					are composed largely of refractory minerals, such as the
					silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals, such as iron
					and nickel, which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets
					(Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres substantial enough to
					generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface
					features, such as rift valleys and volcanoes. The term inner planet
					should not be confused with inferior planet, which designates those
					planets that are closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and
					Venus).
					<br />
					<span class="tab">The </span> four outer planets, or giant planets
					(sometimes called Jovian planets), collectively make up 99% of the
					mass known to orbit the Sun.[g] Jupiter and Saturn are together more
					than 400 times the mass of Earth and consist overwhelmingly of
					hydrogen and helium. Uranus and Neptune are far less massive—less than
					20 Earth masses each—and are composed primarily of ices. For these
					reasons, some astronomers suggest they belong in their own category,
					ice giants.[98] All four giant planets have rings, although only
					Saturn's ring system is easily observed from Earth. The term superior

					consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its
					relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been

					<span class="tab">Neptune</span> (30.1 AU), though slightly smaller
					than Uranus, is more massive and hence more dense. It radiates more
					internal heat, but not as much as Jupiter or Saturn. Neptune has 14
					known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with
					geysers of liquid nitrogen. Triton is the only large satellite with a
					retrograde orbit. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor
					planets, termed Neptune trojans, that are in 1:1 resonance with it.

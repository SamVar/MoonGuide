					Symbolic of a new beginnings, the New Moon signals the end of an
					entire Lunar Cycle which leads to the next New Moon. Those born under
					this phase are supercharged with the renewing, spiritual energy of the
					Universe. They have an affinity for all things creative and tend to be
					imaginative, intuitive and impulsive -- occasionally making decisions
					without thinking them through. Yet when they commit to their passion,
					they do so with a strong resolve to develop, cultivate and make
					manifest. Although, as lunar energy ebbs and flows, staying connected
					to their inner resolve becomes difficult at times. Mania, nervousness
					and racing thoughts may develop, signaling a time to slow down and
					feel the earth underfoot. By letting go of all fears, worries and
					self-judgement, they will begin again to give birth to new ideas and
					concepts. Wear this moon phase to honor birthdays or any sacred date
					and energize your life with the spirit of new beginnings.

					Those born under the influence of this moon phase are assertive,
					adventurous and filled with curiosity about life. Happiest while
					pursuing a worthwhile mission, their drive for achievement is central
					to their success. Typically individuals born in the first half of the
					moon cycle are involved in establishing new structures, systems and
					schools of thought. A creative disposition inspires inquiry and an
					ability to see the world through fresh eyes. Because of this, these
					visionaries are often torn between following conventional wisdom and
					risking all to break new ground. Facing and overcoming imbalance and
					chaos brings likely success early in life when ambition and
					productivity is especially high. Wear this moon phase to honor
					birthdays or any sacred date and capture the lucky sliver of silver
					light to bring heartfelt dreams to fruition.

				</div>
				<p class="born-firstQuarter-parag">
					The first quarter Moon is the first critical point in the Moon cycle
					and there is an element of tension or nervous energy in the heart of
					all individuals born at this time. Like the planet which now must take
					risks as it pours energy into strengthening its position, individuals
					born at the First Quarter Phase are passionate, confident and natural
					risk takers. They are quick to act but can carry a chip on their
					shoulder, as if they are trying to prove something to the world. This
					makes them great leaders as they always rise to challenges. Anger need
					to be managed consciously and healthy physical outlets are important.
					A key phrase for this phase is “Crisis in Action”. First Quarter
					individuals can feel that life is a challenge they need to beat. They
					are ambitious, self motivated and independent and once they’ve decided
					to do something are hard to stop. Determination is one their key
					strengths.

				</div>
				<p class="born-waxingGibbous-parag">
					One of the best lunar phases to give spiritual evolution a boost,
					those born under the influence of this moon phase are quick thinkers
					and grand philosophers that desire to seek out the meaning in life.
					They have a natural talent for communication and self-expression and
					love to analyze everything to come up with solutions that benefit
					everyone. his Moon phase is about self development and perfection,
					symbolic of the plant who is now preparing it’s offerings through
					fruit and flowers. Those born at this Moon phase are acutely aware of
					how important planning and organisation are. Yet, they don’t well in
					isolation. Being in communion with partners, lovers, mentors, teachers
					and friends brings them comfort and the mental and emotional growth
					that leads to their success. Wear this moon phase to honor birthdays
					or any sacred date to attract the partnerships that brings love and
					luck to life.

				<div class="for-center">
					<img src="images/full.png" class="fullMoon-img" alt="Full Moon" />
				</div>
				<p class="born-fullMoon-parag">
					Since the moon controls our emotional energy, those born at its
					fullness may feel its effects in the extreme. Expressing emotions and
					understanding them may be hurdles to conquer. Yet on the positive
					side, they are extroverted and friendly with magnetic personalities
					and known as truthful individuals who are likely to tell it like it
					is. During a full moon, most feel exhilarated, inspired and motived
					toward success and accomplishment while others may feel chaotic and
					disorganized. Full moon babies are also quick studies who master tasks
					easily and are equally given to quick changes of mind and heart which
					to some may appear as fickleness. Even so, their strong intuition is
					always guiding them in making their efforts come to fruition,
					especially when following their passions. Wear this moon phase to
					honor birthdays or any sacred date and channel the moon’s emotional
					wisdom to bring success to personal endeavors.

				</div>
				<p class="born-waningGibbous-parag">
					Sharing the attributes of Waning Gibbous, those born under the
					influence of this moon phase are considered the caretakers of the
					Universe. Their calming influence, caring nature and compulsion to
					help others gives valuable insight into their strong will and
					character and often shows up as a career in public service. An
					eagerness to make the world a better place may tempt them to follow
					ideologies too blindly. This moon phase individuals are precise and
					question everything. They are highly creative without being impulsive.
					Yet most can rely on strong intuitive powers to see that shred of
					waning light before making wrong decisions. Remaining strong in the
					face of adversity, uncertainty and unforeseen obstacles leads to their
					greatest achievements and fulfillment in life. Wear this moon phase to
					honor birthdays or any sacred date to channel strength, enlightenment
					and a generosity of spirit.

				<div class="for-center">
					<img src="images/21.png" class="lastQuarter-img" alt="Last Quarter" />
				</div>
				<p class="born-lastQuarter-parag">
					For people born on Third Quarter the mid life period, from the late
					thirties to early fifties, is filled with change, as previously
					conservative or mainstream Third Quarter individuals make dramatic
					shifts, embracing alternative life choices to pursue a life aligned
					with their personal philosophy. Often there is a key event through
					this time which acts as a catalyst. Friends, family and colleagues may
					struggle to understand why, at the heights of their career, Third
					Quarter types walk away from all they’ve built up. This phase is
					described as a “Crises in Consciousness” which reflects the importance
					of acting in accordance with their beliefs. Third Quarter Moon phase
					types are constantly re-valuating the old, and as they move through
					life, turn away and discard old patterns. Many cut ties with the
					beliefs or philosophies of the culture or community in which they were
					raised. Third Quarter types easily combine instinct with creativity.

				<p class="born-waningCrescent-parag">
					Waning into total darkness, the moon’s shrinking light may decrease
					illumination in the night sky yet intensifies psychic illumination for
					those born under its influence. Feeling attuned to psychic experiences
					and dreamy, otherworldly dimensions is not uncommon as the imagination
					is in full force during this slim moon phase. Their challenge is not
					to lose sight of the real world while staying connected to this
					spiritual gift from the Universe that bridges them to energies beyond
					the earthly realm. Wear this moon phase to honor birthdays or any
					sacred date and delve into the deeply intuitive world of the waning
					crescent. These folks tend to be very reflective and prefer their
					alone time. They are very spiritual and seek to understand the big
					questions in life and may be very intuitive or psychic. Their lesson
					is to distill what they have learned from situations into wisdom to
					share with others.
